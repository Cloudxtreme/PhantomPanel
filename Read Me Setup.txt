REQUIREMENTS:
1. Must have dedicated web server (nginx, apache, lighttpd etc), these files cannot be run in the bot's web server.
2. Dedicated web server must have php5 installed and php5 curl enabled.

This is a browser dashboard for the bot. It uses your internet browser to send commands to your bot. This is not standalone, 
you will need to have the bot running at the same time and in the same machine the dashboard is. 


This is the start of implementing a web-based control panel for the bot. Thanks to crunchprank for his starting work on the previous interface test. 
If at all possible, we would like any contributors to add extra fields to the panel as needed by the bot per different commands, 
and attach them to this thread. 

Steps:
1. Extract the files to your web server.
2. Open includes/config.php
3. Type in your info and save/

Config.php Example:

//Web panel login information - This is only to login into the web panel, you don't need to type in your twitch account info here.
$loginuser=''; //Username you will like to use to login into the dashboard
$loginpass=''; //Password for the username to log into the dashboard

//Bot connection configuration
$baseport=25000;//Leave this alone.
$owner='';//Just put your Twitch username(Not the bot's)
$url=''; //The url can be an IP address or a url you have directing to that IP. all other details are named corresponding to the bot's botlogin.txt.
$oauth='';//Your bot's oauth key, you can find it in your botlogin.txt if you have set your bot up.
