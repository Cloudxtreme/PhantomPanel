REQUIREMENTS:
1. Must have dedicated web server (nginx, apache, lighttpd etc), these files cannot be run in the bot's web server.
2. Dedicated web server must have php installed and enabled.
3. Php must have curl enabled.

This is the start of implementing a web-based control panel for the bot. Thanks to crunchprank for his starting work on the previous interface test. 
If at all possible, we would like any contributors to add extra fields to the panel as needed by the bot per different commands, 
and attach them to this thread. 

Steps:
1. Extract the files to your web server.
2. Open includes/config.php
3. Type in your info and save/

Config.php Example:
//Web panel login information - This is only to login into the web panel, you don't need to type in your twitch account info here.
$loginuser='username';
$loginpass='password';

//Bot connection configuration
$baseport=25000;
$owner='your twitch username';
$url='URL for your web server'; //The url can be an IP address or a url you have directing to that IP. all other details are named corresponding to the bot's botlogin.txt.
$oauth='your bot's oauth key';
$botpath='where your bot folder is located';

The url can be an IP address or a url you have directing to that IP. all other details are named corresponding to the bot's botlogin.txt.

Then navigate to the the index.php you extracted to your web server, via your browser. 
Test the buttons. check the bot console periodically to make sure the commands show up and no odd errors occur. If they do please report them.

MUSIC PLAYER:
To enable the queue list you must first follow these steps.
Steps:
1.Open the config.php you edited before with your bot details
2.Set the folder for your bot in $botpath=""
3. Go to the web panel and click on Music Player on the top.
4. Click on both "Enable Storing" and "Set StorePath"

This should do the trick for you.
